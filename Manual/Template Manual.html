                        <p>You have been given a powerful opponent, and in order to take them down, you must submit the right combination of sounds to launch your attack.<br><br>
						To aid you in finding the right combination, a total of four pictures out of five symbols will be presented on the module.<br>
						- For every Turtle present, select "KA - ME"<br>
						- For every Staff present, select "HA - ME"<br>
						- For every Tail present, select "HA"<br>
						- If Stars are present, repeat the selections 2 times for every set of stars<br></p>

                        <h3 style="text-decoration:none">The Z clause</h3><br>
						If there is a Z present, the order of the selections will be altered from the original sequence. The original sequence goes as follows: <b>Turtle selections and Staff selections alternate, followed by any Tail selections, then repeat the sequence for the number of Stars present.</b><br>
						The changes to the sequence will be as follows, based on the first rule that applies:<br>
						- If the Turtle is present in the top left, replace all staff selections with ME - KA<br>
						- If the Turtle is present in the top right, change any second sound in a selection so that it matches the first. [HA - ME becomes HA - HA]<br>
						- If the Staff is present in the bottom left, replace all turtle selections with ME - HA<br>
						- If the Tail is present in the bottom right, reverse the entire sequence.<br>
						- If only Stars are present, enter sequence: HA - ME - HA - ME - KA<br>
						
						<h3 style="text-decoration:none">Four of a Kind</h3><br>
						There is a small chance that all of the symbols will be the same. Enter the solution as follows, ignoring all above rules:<br>
						-Turtle/Staff: KA - ME<br>
						-Tail: KA - ME - HA<br>
						-Star: KA - ME - HA - ME - HA<br>
						-Z: Enter whatever you want! As soon as your sequence is complete, the module will be solved.
